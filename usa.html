  <h2>  Getting Around</h2>
    <h2>Air
When time is tight, book a flight. The domestic air system is extensive and reliable, with dozens of competing airlines, hundreds of airports and thousands of flights daily. Flying is usually more expensive than traveling by bus, train or car, but it's the way to go when you're in a hurry.
<br>
<br>
Main 'hub' airports in the USA include all international gateways plus many other large cities. Most cities and towns have a local or county airport, but you usually have to travel via a hub airport to reach them.
<br>
<br>
Airlines in USA
Overall, air travel in the USA is very safe (much safer than driving out on the nation's highways); for comprehensive details by carrier, check out airsafe.com.
<br>
<br>
The main domestic carriers:
<br>
<br>
Alaska Airlines (www.alaskaair.com) Has direct flights to Anchorage from Seattle, Chicago, Los Angeles and Denver. It also flies between many towns within Alaska.
<br>
<br>
American Airlines (www.aa.com) Nationwide service.
<br>
<br>
Delta Air Lines (www.delta.com) Nationwide service.
<br>
<br>
Frontier Airlines (www.flyfrontier.com) Denver-based airline with service across the continental USA.
<br>
<br>
Hawaiian Airlines (www.hawaiianairlines.com) Nonstop flights between the Hawaiian islands and various spots on the mainland.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Virgin America (www.virginamerica.com) California-based airline serving over two dozen cities, from Honolulu to Boston.
<br>
<br>
Air Passes
International travelers who plan on doing a lot of flying might consider buying a North American air pass. Passes are normally available only to non–North American citizens, and they must be purchased in conjunction with an international ticket. Conditions and cost structures can be complicated, but all passes include a certain number of domestic flights (from as few as two to as many as 16, depending on airline network) that typically must be used within a 60-day period. Often you must plan your itinerary in advance, but sometimes dates (and even destinations) can be left open. Talk with a travel agent to determine if an air pass will save you money. Networks offering air passes include Star Alliance (www.staralliance.com), One World (www.oneworld.com) and Skyteam (www.skyteam.com).
<br>
<br>
Bicycle
Regional bicycle touring is popular. It means coasting along winding backroads (because bicycles are often not permitted on freeways) and calculating progress in miles per day, not miles per hour. Cyclists must follow the same rules of the road as automobiles, but don't expect drivers to respect your right of way. Better World Club (www.betterworldclub.com) offers a bicycle roadside-assistance program.
<br>
<br>
For epic cross-country journeys, get the support of a tour operator; it's about two months of dedicated pedaling coast to coast.
<br>
<br>
For advice, route maps, guided tours and lists of local bike clubs and repair shops, browse the websites of Adventure Cycling (www.adventurecycling.org) and the League of American Bicyclists (www.bikeleague.org). If you're bringing your own bike to the USA, be sure to call around to check oversize luggage prices and restrictions. Amtrak trains and Greyhound buses will transport bikes within the USA, sometimes charging extra.
<br>
<br>
It's not hard to buy a bike once you're here and resell it before you leave. Every city and town has bike shops; if you prefer a cheaper, used bicycle, try garage sales, bulletin boards at hostels and colleges, or the free classified ads on Craigslist (craigslist.org). These are also the best places to sell your bike, though stores selling used bikes may also buy from you.
<br>
<br>
Long-term bike rentals are also easy to find. Rates run from $100 per week and up, and a credit-card authorization for several hundred dollars is usually necessary as a security deposit.
<br>
<br>
Some cities are more amenable to bicycles than others, but most have at least a few dedicated bike lanes and paths, and bikes can usually be carried on public transportation.
<br>
<br>
Boat
There is no river or canal public-transportation system in the USA, but there are many smaller, often state-run, coastal ferry services. These provide efficient, scenic links to the many islands off both coasts. Most larger ferries will transport private cars, motorcycles and bicycles.
<br>
<br>
The most spectacular coastal ferry runs are on the southeastern coast of Alaska and along the Inside Passage. The Great Lakes have several islands that can be visited only by boat, such as Mackinac Island, MI; the Apostle Islands, off Wisconsin; and remote Isle Royale National Park, MI. Off the Pacific coast, ferries serve the scenic San Juan Islands in Washington and Catalina Island in California.
<br>
<br>
Bus
To save money, travel by bus, particularly between major towns and cities. Middle-class Americans prefer to fly or drive, but buses let you see the countryside and meet folks along the way. As a rule, buses are reliable, cleanish and comfortable, with air-conditioning, barely reclining seats, lavatories and no smoking.
<br>
<br>
Greyhound (www.greyhound.com) is the major long-distance bus company, with routes throughout the USA and Canada. Routes generally trace major highways and stop at larger population centers. To reach country towns on rural roads, you may need to transfer to local or county bus systems; Greyhound can usually provide their contact information.
<br>
<br>
Competing with Greyhound is the extensive Trailways network (www.trailways.com). The 70-plus bus companies that make up Trailways operate on an interlining basis with Greyhound and New England–based Peter Pan (https://peterpanbus.com), and the Trailways website searches both Greyhound and Trailways fares. Other long-distance bus lines that offer decent fares and free wi-fi (though it doesn't always work) include Megabus (www.megabus.com) and BoltBus (www.boltbus.com).
<br>
<br>
Most baggage has to be checked in; label it loudly and clearly to avoid it getting lost. Larger items, including skis, surfboards and bicycles, can be transported, but there may be an extra charge. Call to check.
<br>
<br>
The frequency of bus services varies widely, depending on the route. Despite the elimination of many tiny destinations, non-express Greyhound buses still stop every 50 to 100 miles to pick up passengers, and long-distance buses will stop for meal breaks and driver changes.
<br>
<br>
Many bus stations are clean and safe, but some are in dodgy areas. If you arrive in the evening, it's worth spending the money on a taxi. Some towns have just a flag stop. If you are boarding at one of these, pay the driver with exact change.
<br>
<br>
Most cities and larger towns have dependable local bus systems, though they are often designed for commuters and provide limited service in the evening and on weekends. Costs range from free to between $1 and $4 per ride.
<br>
<br>
Costs
For lower fares on Greyhound, purchase tickets ahead of time (purchasing 14 or more days in advance usually nets the best bargains). Special promotional fares are regularly offered on Greyhound's website, especially for online bookings (see www.greyhound.com/promos for details).
<br>
<br>
As for other Greyhound discounts: tickets for children aged two to 16 are discounted 20% during non-peak periods; seniors over 62 years get a whopping 5% off; and students get 10% off if they have purchased the $23 Student Advantage Discount Card (www.studentadvantage.com).
<br>
<br>
Reservations
Tickets for most trips on Greyhound, Trailways, Megabus and BoltBus can be bought online. You can print all tickets at home or, in the case of Megabus or BoltBus, simply show ticket receipts through an email on a smartphone. Greyhound also allows customers to pick up tickets at the terminal using 'Will Call' service.
<br>
<br>
Seating is normally first-come, first-served. Greyhound recommends arriving an hour before departure to get a seat.
<br>

New York–San Francisco	175	72
Washington, DC–Miami	150	25-30
Car & Motorcycle
For maximum flexibility and convenience, and to explore rural America and its wide-open spaces, a car is essential. Fuel prices average around $2.90/gallon, and you can often score fairly inexpensive rentals (NYC excluded), with rates as low as $25 per day.
<br>
<br>
Automobile Associations
The American Automobile Association (AAA; www.aaa.com) has reciprocal membership agreements with several international auto clubs (check with AAA and bring your membership card from home). For its members, AAA offers travel insurance, tour books, diagnostic centers for used-car buyers and a wide-ranging network of regional offices. AAA advocates politically for the auto industry.
<br>
<br>
A more ecofriendly alternative, the Better World Club (www.betterworldclub.com), donates 1% of revenue to assist environmental cleanup, offers ecologically sensitive choices for every service it provides and advocates politically for environmental causes.
<br>
<br>
With these organizations, the primary member benefit is 24-hour emergency roadside assistance anywhere in the USA. Both also offer trip planning, free travel maps, travel-agency services, car insurance and a range of travel discounts (eg on hotels, car rentals, attractions).
<br>
<br>
Bring Your Own Vehicle
It's possible to drive your own car over the border from Canada or Mexico. Unless you're moving to the USA, don't even think about freighting your car from overseas.
<br>
<br>
Drive-Away Cars
'Drive-away cars' refers to the business of driving cars across the country for people who are moving or otherwise can't transport their own vehicles. For flexible travelers, they can be a dream come true: you can cover the long distances between A and B for the price of gas. Timing and availability are key.
<br>
<br>
To be a driver you must be at least 23 years old with a valid driver's license (non-US citizens should have an International Driving Permit). You'll also need to provide a $350 deposit – sometimes requested in cash – which is refunded upon safe delivery of the car, a printout of your 'clean' driving record from home, a major credit card and a passport (or three other forms of identification).
<br>
<br>
The drive-away company provides insurance; you pay for gas. The stipulation is that you must deliver the car to its destination within a specified time and mileage, which usually requires that you drive no more than eight hours and about 400 miles a day along the shortest route (ie no sightseeing). Availability depends on demand.
<br>
<br>
One major company is Auto Driveaway (www.autodriveaway.com/driver), which has more than 40 offices nationwide.
<br>
<br>
Driver's License
Foreign visitors can legally drive a car in the USA for up to 12 months using their home driver's license. However, an International Driving Permit (IDP) will have more credibility with US traffic police, especially if your home license doesn't have a photo or isn't in English. Your automobile association at home can issue an IDP, valid for one year, for a small fee. Always carry your home license together with the IDP.
<br>
<br>
To ride a motorcycle in the USA, you will need either a valid US state motorcycle license or an IDP specially endorsed for motorcycles.
<br>
<br>
Fueling Up
Many gas stations in the USA have fuel pumps with automated credit-card pay screens. Some machines ask for your ZIP code after you swipe your card. For foreign travelers, or those with cards issued outside the US, you'll have to pay inside before fueling up. Just indicate how much you'd like to put on the card. If there's still credit left over after you fuel up, pop back inside and the attendant will put the difference back on your card.
<br>
<br>
Insurance
Don't put the key into the ignition if you don't have insurance, which is legally required. You risk financial ruin and legal consequences if there's an accident. If you already have auto insurance, or if you buy travel insurance that covers car rentals, make sure your policy has adequate liability coverage for where you will be driving, as different states specify different minimum levels of coverage.
<br>
<br>
Car-rental companies will provide liability insurance, but most charge extra. Rental companies almost never include collision-damage insurance for the vehicle. Instead, they offer an optional Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) or Loss Damage Waiver (LDW), usually with an initial deductible cost of between $100 and $500. For an extra premium, you can usually get this deductible covered as well. Paying for some or all of this insurance increases the cost of a rental car by as much as $30 a day.
<br>
<br>
Many credit cards offer free collision damage coverage for rental cars if you rent for 15 days or less and charge the total rental to your card. This is a good way to avoid paying extra fees to the rental company, but note that if there's an accident, sometimes you must pay the car-rental company first and then seek reimbursement from the credit-card company. There may be exceptions that are not covered, too, such as 'exotic' rentals (eg 4WD Jeeps or convertibles). Check your credit-card policy.
<br>
<br>
Purchase
Buying a car is much more hassle than it's worth, particularly for foreign visitors and for trips of less than four months. Foreigners will have the easiest time arranging this if they have stateside friends or relatives who can provide a fixed address for registration, licensing and insurance.
<br>
<br>
Once purchased, the car's transfer of ownership papers must be registered with the state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) within 10 days – you'll need the bill of sale, the title (or 'pink slip') and proof of insurance. Some states also require a 'smog certificate.' This is the seller's responsibility, so don't buy a car without a current certificate. A dealer will submit all necessary paperwork to the DMV for you.
<br>
<br>
For foreigners, independent liability insurance is difficult to virtually impossible to arrange without a US driver's license. A car dealer or AAA may be able to suggest an insurer who will do this. Even with a local license, insurance can be expensive and difficult to obtain if you don't have evidence of a good driving record. Bring copies of your home auto-insurance policy if it helps establish that you are a good risk. All drivers under 25 years old will have problems getting insurance.
<br>
<br>
Finally, selling a car can become a desperate business. Selling to dealers gets you the worst price, but involves a minimum of paperwork. Otherwise, fellow travelers and college students are the best bets – but be sure the DMV is properly notified about the sale, or you may be on the hook for someone else's traffic tickets later on.
<br>
<br>
Car Rental
Car rental is a competitive business in the USA. Most rental companies require that you have a major credit card, be at least 25 years old and have a valid driver's license. Some major national companies may rent to drivers between the ages of 21 and 24 for an additional charge of around $25 per day. Except in Michigan and New York, those under age 21 are not permitted to rent at all.
<br>
<br>
Car-rental prices vary wildly, so shop around. The average daily rate for a small car ranges from around $25 to $75, or $125 to $500 per week. If you belong to an auto club or frequent-flier program, you may get a discount (or earn rewards points or miles).
<br>
<br>
Some other things to keep in mind: most national agencies make 'unlimited mileage' standard on all cars, but independents might charge extra for this. Tax on car rental varies by state and agency location; always ask for the total cost including all taxes and fees. Most agencies charge more if you pick the car up in one place and drop it off in another, and usually only national agencies offer this option. Be careful about adding extra days or turning in a car early – extra days may be charged at a premium rate, or an early return may jeopardize any weekly or monthly discounts you originally arranged.
<br>
<br>
Some major national companies, including Avis, Budget and Hertz, offer 'green' fleets of hybrid or electric rental cars (eg Toyota Prius or Nissan Leafs), though you'll usually have to pay quite a bit more. Some independent local agencies, especially on the West Coast, also offer hybrid-vehicle rentals. Try Hawaii's Bio-Beetle (www.bio-beetle.com) or Green Motion USA (www.greenmotionusa.com) in Florida or California.
<br>
<br>
Motorcycle & Recreational Vehicle (RV) Rental
If you dream of cruising across America on a Harley, EagleRider (www.eaglerider.com) rents motorcycles in major cities nationwide. If a recreational vehicle (RV) is more your style, places such as www.usarvrentals.com and www.cruiseamerica.com can help. Beware: rental and insurance fees for these vehicles are expensive.
<br>
<br>
Road Conditions & Hazards
America's highways are thought of as legendary ribbons of unblemished asphalt, but that's not always the case. Road hazards include potholes, city commuter traffic, wandering wildlife and cell-phone-wielding, kid-distracted or enraged drivers. Caution, foresight, courtesy and luck usually gets you past them. For nationwide traffic and road-closure information, check www.fhwa.dot.gov/trafficinfo.
<br>
<br>
In places where winter driving is an issue, many cars are fitted with steel-studded snow tires, while snow chains can sometimes be required in mountain areas.
Driving off-road, or on dirt roads, is often forbidden by car-rental companies, and it can be very dangerous in wet weather.
In deserts and range country, livestock sometimes graze next to unfenced roads. These areas are signed as 'Open Range' or with the silhouette of a steer.
Where deer and other wild animals frequently appear roadside, you'll see signs with the silhouette of a leaping deer. Take these signs seriously, particularly at dusk and dawn.
Road Rules
In the USA, cars drive on the right-hand side of the road.
The use of seat belts is required in every state except New Hampshire, and child safety seats or seat belts for children under 18 are required in every state. Most car-rental agencies rent child safety seats for $10 to $14 per day, but you must reserve them when booking.
In some states, motorcyclists are required to wear helmets.
On interstate highways, the speed limit is usually 70mph. Unless otherwise posted, the speed limit is generally 55mph or 65mph on highways, 25mph to 35mph in cities and towns, and as low as 15mph in school zones (strictly enforced during school hours). It's forbidden to pass a school bus when its lights are flashing.
Unless signs prohibit it, you may turn right at a red light after first coming to a full stop – note that turning right on red is illegal in NYC.
At four-way stop signs, cars should proceed in order of arrival; when two cars arrive simultaneously, the one on the right has the right of way. When in doubt, just politely wave the other driver ahead.
When emergency vehicles (ie police, fire or ambulance) approach from either direction, pull over safely and get out of the way.
In many states, it's illegal to talk on a handheld cell phone while driving; use a hands-free device instead.
The maximum legal blood-alcohol concentration for drivers is 0.08%. Penalties are very severe for 'DUI' – driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. Police can give roadside sobriety checks to assess if you've been drinking or using drugs. If you fail, they'll require you to take a breath test, urine test or blood test to determine the level of alcohol or drugs in your body. Refusing to be tested is treated the same as if you'd taken the test and failed.
In some states it's illegal to carry 'open containers' of alcohol in a vehicle, even if they're empty.
If you are pulled over by the police, do not get out of your car. Wait for the officer to approach your window – in the meantime, collect your license, proof of insurance and registration or rental agreement, and have them ready for the officer to inspect.
Public Transportation
Except in large US cities, public transportation is rarely the most convenient option for travelers, and coverage can be sparse to outlying towns and suburbs. However, it is usually cheap, safe and reliable.
<br>
<br>
More than two-thirds of the states in the nation have adopted 511 as an all-purpose local-transportation help line.
<br>
<br>
Subway
The largest subway systems are in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Washington, DC, the San Francisco Bay Area, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Other cities have small, one- or two-line rail systems that mainly serve downtown areas.
<br>
<br>
Light rail systems (trams and trollies) are becoming increasingly popular in the US. Denver, Seattle, San Diego, Minneapolis and Portland are among the many places with light rail systems, as are most cities with subways (the networks usually connect, and rides are transferable).
<br>
<br>
Taxis & Ride-Sharing Services
Taxis are metered, with flagfall charges of around $3 to start, plus $2 to $3 per mile. They charge extra for waiting and handling baggage, and drivers expect a 10% to 15% tip. Taxis cruise the busiest areas in large cities; elsewhere, it's easiest to phone and order one.
<br>
<br>
Ridesharing companies such as Uber (www.uber.com) and Lyft (www.lyft.com) have seen a surge in popularity as an alternative to taxis.
<br>
<br>
Train
Amtrak (www.amtrak.com) has an extensive rail system throughout the USA, with Amtrak's Thruway buses providing connections to and from the rail network to some smaller centers and national parks. Compared with other modes of travel, trains are rarely the quickest, cheapest, timeliest or most convenient option, but they turn the journey into a relaxing, social and scenic all-American experience, especially on western routes, where double-decker Superliner trains boast spacious lounge cars with panoramic windows.
<br>
<br>
Amtrak has several long-distance lines traversing the nation east to west, and even more running north to south. These connect all of America's biggest cities and many of its smaller ones. Long-distance services (on named trains) mostly operate daily on these routes, but some run only three to five days per week. See Amtrak's website for detailed route maps.
<br>
<br>
Commuter trains provide faster, more frequent services on shorter routes, especially the northeast corridor from Boston, MA, to Washington, DC. Amtrak's high-speed Acela Express trains are the most expensive, and rail passes are not valid on these trains. Other commuter rail lines include those serving the Lake Michigan shoreline near Chicago, IL, major cities on the West Coast and the Miami, FL, area.
<br><br>
Classes & Costs
Amtrak fares vary according to the type of train and seating. On long-distance lines, you can travel in coach seats (reserved or unreserved), business class, or 1st class, which includes all sleeping compartments. Sleeping cars include simple bunks (called 'roomettes'), bedrooms with en-suite facilities and suites sleeping four with two bathrooms. Sleeping-car rates include meals in the dining car, which offers everyone sit-down meal service (pricey if not included). Food service on commuter lines, when it exists, consists of sandwich and snack bars. Bringing your own food and drink is recommended on all trains.
<br>
<br>
Various one-way, round-trip and touring fares are available from Amtrak, with discounts of 15% for students with a valid ID and seniors aged 62 and over, and 50% for children aged two to 12 when accompanied by a paying adult. AAA members get 10% off. Web-only 'SmartFares' offer 30% discounts on certain undersold routes (destinations change weekly; see www.aaa.com for details).
<br>
<br>
Generally the earlier you book, the lower the price. To get many of the standard discounts, you need to reserve at least three days in advance. If you want to take an Acela Express or Metroliner train, avoid peak commute times and aim for weekends.
<br>
<br>
Amtrak Vacations (www.amtrakvacations.com) offers vacation packages that include car rental, hotels, tours and attractions. Air-Rail packages let you travel by train in one direction, then return by plane the other way.
<br>
<br>
Reservations
Reservations can be made any time from 11 months in advance up to the day of departure. Space on most trains is limited, and certain routes can be crowded, especially during summer and holiday periods, so it's a good idea to book as far in advance as you can. This also gives you the best chance of fare discounts.
<br>
<br>
Train Passes
Amtrak's USA Rail Pass offers coach-class travel for 15 ($459), 30 ($689) or 45 ($899) days, with travel limited to eight, 12 or 18 one-way 'segments,' respectively. A segment is not the same as a one-way trip. If reaching your destination requires riding more than one train (for example, getting from New York to Miami with a transfer in Washington, DC), that one-way trip will actually use two segments of your pass.
<br>
<br>
Present your pass at an Amtrak office to pick up your ticket(s) for each trip. Reservations should be made by phone (call 800-872-7245, or 215-856-7953 from outside the USA). Book desired dates as far in advance as possible, as seats allocated for USA Rail Pass holders are limited. At some rural stations, trains will only stop if there's a reservation. Tickets are not for specific seats, but a conductor on board may allocate you a seat. Business-class, first-class and sleeper accommodations cost extra and must be reserved separately.
<br>
<br>
All travel must be completed within 330 days of purchasing your pass. Passes are not valid on the Acela Express, Auto Train, Thruway motorcoach connections, or the Canadian portion of Amtrak routes operated jointly with Via Rail Canada.

Who doesn't enjoy the steamy puff and whistle of a mighty locomotive as glorious scenery streams by? Dozens of historic narrow-gauge railroads still operate today as attractions, rather than as transportation. Most trains only run in the warmer months, and they can be extremely popular – so book ahead.
