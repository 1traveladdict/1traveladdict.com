		Traveling to Europe with so many options can be confusing. Deciding how to travel from one destination to the next can also be costly. In the last ten years quite a few budget airlines are available.  The best option is to use a travel search engine to find the best flights available <a href=("https://www.skyscanner.com/")>SKYSCANNER</a>. 
		<br>
		<br>
		 Also using a travel aggregator <a href=("https://www.rome2rio.com/")>ROME2RIO</a> to find the easiest options traveling from point A to point B.

		  ATM fees can be very steep
		  always use a credit card from a credit union, Fidelity Investments or Charles Swab as they refund your  fees when you ATM use their cards. Depositing funds into a cash card with these companies lets you travel without carrying a lot of cash with you. 
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  Taking a credit card with you make sure its a card card that does not charge foreign transaction fees.
