                January and February in Tanzania
             </h3>
         </p>
         <p><h5>
            The Great Migration of wildebeests from Tanzania’s Serengeti to Kenya’s Masai Mara is awe-inspiring, to say the least. The precise timing of it is dependent upon rainfall patterns each year, meaning you can see different aspects of it at different times: the mass birthing of calves between January and March in the southern Serengeti, and river crossings between July and August.
<br>
<br>
            In addition to wildebeests, safari-goers will also have the chance to spot Africa’s most famous predator, lions. Prides of lions will follow the herds for the prime hunting opportunity they present. Cheetahs, wild dogs and hyenas also make appearances as they try to take down vulnerable members of the herd. If you’re lucky, you might even see a wildebeest or zebra giving birth.</h5>

         <<h3>Safari in March or April Ethiopia</h3>
         <p><h5>
            The weather is fairly temperate throughout the entire year here so visiting in any season is an option, but it’s a little rainier from June to September. A few months before this time is hot, but not too hot.
<br>
<br>
            The Simien Mountains National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is one of the best places to go on a safari adventure. The park’s sweeping mountains and deep valleys, the result of erosive activity, are covered in the deep green of alpine forests. Animals living in the park include caracals, leopards, jackals, hyenas, bushbucks, klipspringers and hundreds of species of birds. Safari-goers might also glimpse the rate Simien fox or Walia ibex.</h5>

         <h3>Rwanda July and August</h3>
         <p><h5>
            July and August are right in the midst of Rwanda’s dry season (which takes place from June through to September). These two months are very popular for booking gorilla trekking adventures because of the clear skies and sunny conditions. The gorillas live in Rwanda’s rainforests, mainly within the bounds of Volcanoes National Park. Here, you can also see chimpanzees and colobus monkeys living among the trees. Keep in mind that gorilla habitat is, by default, very wet and you can’t avoid rain completely. However, after heavy rain, the skies often open up to bright sunshine.</h5>

         <h3>September and October in Ghana

         </h3>
         <p><h5>
            There is some light rainfall in September and October, but these two months are still part of the dry season in Ghana. You won’t have to worry about heavy rains causing flooding or travel delays. Birdwatchers will love taking a canopy tour through Kakum National Park – you can spot guinea fowl, African grey parrots and many other types of birds flitting through the trees. The national park is also home to forest elephants, civets, leopards, pangolins, a variety of monkeys and more.</h5>S

         <h3>Kenya</h3>
         <p><h5>
            With more than 40 national parks and reserves, Kenya is a dream destination for safaris. This country draws tourists year-round, but September and October have certain advantages. These months are part of the dry season and the weather is also cooler. During these months, you can also catch the iconic Masai Mara migration</h5>

         <h3>
             Ivory Coast November and December
         </h3>
<p><h5>
    November and December are the first two months of the warm and dry season in Ivory Coast. The temperate weather and minimal rainfall are ideal for travelers. And Taï National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is perfect for wildlife seekers. The park protects a tropical rainforest and its inhabitants include chimpanzees, pygmy hippos, leopards, colobus monkeys, flying squirrels, two species of bat, a variety of birds and much more.</h5>

<h3>Uganda </h3>
<p><h5>
    Let’s face it, who doesn’t want to go mountain gorilla trekking in Uganda? If you do, it’s probably worth heading to Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, a rainforest that nearly half of the world’s mountain gorilla population call home. The peak period to travel tends to be June through to September when skies are clear, there is less rain and more sunshine. BUT traveling in the low season of November is a great opportunity to make the most of competitive prices, including permits which are almost half the price. (Permits in Uganda are seasonal, as opposed to Rwanda’s year-round flat price ones.)</h5>
