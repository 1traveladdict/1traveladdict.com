        <h3>First thing to check is that your passport has at least 6 months before expiration.  The other important factor is to chck that the country you are requesting a visa to does not have any problems from a country you previously have visited.
        The application can be done directly to the country but this will take longer but be less expensive.
        <br>
        <br>
        Another issue is whether you are visiting a country such as Cuba which will stamp your passport unless you hand them a piece of paper that they will stamp. This must be kept with the passport until you leave the country. Another country with this issue is the greek side of Cyprus.  If you enter the Turkish side, again you need to hand them a piece of paper to stamp.
